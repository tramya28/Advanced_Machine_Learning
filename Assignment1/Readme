1.	Save 50 reviews from Amazon. Try to use 5 star and 1-2 star reviews to get a comprehensive training set.
2.	Identify 10 keywords or key phrases indicative of buyer’s attitude. Use these words or phrases as features. 
3.	Reviews should be classified as positive (class 1) or negative (class 2).
4.	Train Naïve Bayes classifier using 40 reviews as training examples.
5.	Validate your classifier on the remaining 10 reviews. Report the accuracy of your classifier.
6.	Apply your classifier to 10 reviews not from your training set. Report how your results agree with the numbers of stars given by the authors of that reviews.
Selection of features is up to you. You have to implement your own classifier, do not use any library version.
